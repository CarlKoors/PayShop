> Introduction

  Hello my name is Carl, I am a student at -redacted- Highschool studying Information Technology (I.T). 
I have been coding since I was about 8 or 9-- currently 17 until 30/4. I started to gain a the basic skills
needed to be a full stack developer around the age of 15. I know C(++/#) HTML/CSS/PHP/JS-- these are the only
important ones I know a lot more but I don't really have a current use for them. This project started out as a
***PASSION** PROJECT*.
