> Introduction

  Hello my name is Carl, I am a student at -redacted- Highschool studying Information Technology (I.T). 
I have been coding since I was about 8 or 9-- currently 17 until 30/4. I started to gain a the basic skills
needed to be a full stack developer around the age of 15. I know C(++/#) HTML/CSS/PHP/JS-- these are the only
important ones I know a lot more but I don't really have a current use for them. This project started out as a
***PASSION** PROJECT*.

> INFORMATION REGARDING PAYSHOP
  You will need to use the documenation-- markdown file --provided to gain an understanding of how to use this
app correctly.

## SUPPORTED OS / OTHER
  PayShop does not-- with no future plans to-- support windows. Considering windows has forced updates linux
is just a better operating system for this usecase.
  To get started:
  1. install node & npm.
  2. run the following command to install **ALL** depenacies.
  3. download the repo & run setup.sh 
  - `sudo bash setup.sh`
#### What does setup.sh do?
  The bash script is designed to create a local system service to automatically restart the bot.
  upon an **error** *OR* **system restart**. It does this with the file startup.service-- kinda like a driver but for linux.
